Materials for the TRIA-FoR Apr 2025 Seminar "Data Wrangling in R with the Tidyverse"

## Download the materials
1. Download the Rproject.zip file - click on the file above and download raw data (or use CMD+SHIFT+S). You can also download all repository files by clicking on "Code" and selecting "Download ZIP".
2. Unzip and open the .rproj file.
3. "r_scripts/Tidy_seminar_script_Apr17-2025.R" may already be open, if not, load that in the R Project window. *NOTE: relative paths may not work if you run the script outside of the R Project.*
4. You will need the following packages installed: tidyverse, janitor, gt, MaizePal, knitcitations. All are on CRAN except MaizePal (https://github.com/AndiKur4/MaizePal), which has the devtool install code included on line 88.
5. Additional instructions on installing R, RStudio, and packages are included in the slides pdf.

## Additional Notes:
A copy of output files generated by the R script are already included in the Rproject.zip, in case you run into issues. When you run the code, you will overwrite them.

***The datasets are entirely made up.*** So feel free to share and reuse them. But please cite me, and include any citations I've included, when sharing the slides.
